- Make it so that the ball doesn't start clipping underground and that it always bounces slightly upwards??? or something
- Currently the ball also starts losing height each bounce on the floor? (I would guess it gets slightly stuck on the ground so there should be a check that doesn't let it trigger collision when the ball is going the other direction.... Nope wasn't it... Checked it)
