## To-Do
- Make it so that the ball doesn't start clipping underground and that it always bounces slightly upwards??? or something (Already did a horrible hack to somewhat remedy this)
- Currently the ball also starts losing height each bounce on the floor? (I would guess it gets slightly stuck on the ground so there should be a check that doesn't let it trigger collision when the ball is going the other direction.... Nope wasn't it... Checked it)
- Add copy (and paste if you can) functionality to ip address and port fields
- Perhaps slow the ball down or stop the ball completely with a speshul effect when waiting for a new action from the server
- Make the channel name changeable so that more than 2 player can make a server at a time
